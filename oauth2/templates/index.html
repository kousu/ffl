  <h1>"Easy" (social) sign-in plugin</h1>
  <!-- "omniauth" "*-auth", "multiauth" ? "python-omniauth" -->
  <section>
  <p>This demonstrates a <a href="http://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/">requests-oauthlib</a>-based social-sign-in plugin.
  It is meant to be a simpler alternative to <a href="http://psa.matiasaguirre.net/">python-social-auth</a>.</p>


  <p>This lib doesn't escape the onerous registration problem of OAuth, but it makes the rest of implementation a lot smoother and allows you to skip OAuth if you don't want it.</p>
  
  <p>We support multiple identity providers in one API.
  For our purposes an identity (<code>current_user.id</code>) is a string "provider:address".
  For example "facebook:49353534543", "mailto:nick@kousu.ca", "openid:http://harrypotterxxmalfoy.livejournal.com",</p>
  <p>We have no notion of merged identities; if someone subscribes twice with different accounts, they <b>should</b> show up as different accounts,
  and it'll be up to them to say "oh yeah, by the way, this is also me".
  </p>
  <p>This lib <em>only</em> focuses on consuming identity: it asks a visitor to prove that they are someone, then based on knowing who your code can react differently.
  In other words, this is an authentication library.
  OAuth is an authorization library, and allows many many more things to happen than just proving you own a particular address (for varying definitions of address);
  we do not expose any of that.
  </p>

  <p>Users can authenticate with these providers:
  <ul>
  <li> Username/password
    <ul><li>the traditional give-me-a-password-and-i'll-remember-it deal</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li> Email
    <ul><li>sends a token to the given address. The user clicks the link and returns the token</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li> SMS
    <ul>
     <li>same scheme as Email, except that the codes are shorter so that they aren't onerous to type manually from a phone to the site</li>
     <li>requires set up: you need to pay for an SMS bridge; currently [I plan to support] <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> for no better reason than that they have good python starter code) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Any OpenID server 
   <ul><li> (so, Livejournal and Yahoo and Vk, basically; OpenID is dead :( )</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li> Most OAuth providers. 
   <ul><li>By far the most widely deployed identity scheme, if you don't count email (which some people don't)</li>
       <li>Works by bumping you over to the OAuth provider, waiting for you to auth or not auth, and then running provider-specific glue code which extracts your basic profile data.</li>
       <li>(requires registering your site with each provider, which is a total bitch</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li> <a href="https://indieauth.com/">IndieAuth</a>? </a>
   <ul><li>(just to add an extra layer of indirection to an already complicated system) </li></ul>
  </li>
  <li> Pseudoanonymous throwaway identity</li>
  <li> Token
    <ul><li>For each user created by one of the other methods, a token is generated (much like a session cookie).
            Going to /login/token?t=&lt;token&gt;&amp;next=&lt;url&gt; will log you in and bump you over to the given URL</li>
        <li>combine this with RSS to make personalized RSS feeds</li>
        <li>bookmark it to be able to browse the site logged-in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
 
  </ul>
  <p>
  Consider not enabling username/password login. It requires keeping something that looks like an account around, and those suck and people hate them.
  </p>

  <p>
  Email and SMS auth are totally separate from username auth in this system.
  Using them is like signing into sites by *always* doing "forgot password" and immediately forgetting it again once you're in, just without the hassle of actually picking a password.
  </p>
  
  <em>Token</em> is special, and you may also not wish to enable it.
  Since it is sent back in a GET request there is a CSRF vuln! The vuln doesn't allow editing accounts, but what it does allow is an attacker to silently log you in as someone else, i.e. session-pinning.
  If you don't notice the pinning you might. Because of this, you should not enable.

  It allows skipping reauthentication, which means a token is like an infinite password, one that can even outlive the original account.
  For this reason, tokens can be revoked or changed, and your site should incorporate expiry notices so that your subscribers can get a new token.
  For the use cases I have in mind, like bookmarks, the token should be permanent.
  Reauthing OAuth and OpenID is transparent if you're already logged in to your provider, but email, SMS and username can be annoying.
  Note well that token authd allows the pseudoanon accounts to be kept instead of immediately tossed by providing a way to re-log in to them.
