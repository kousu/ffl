Login Pseudoanonymously
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

  <p>Logging in pseudoanonymously generates a universally unique username.
  There are no passwords, no verifications, nothing in the way of making a new identity.
  No one before you and no one after you will have this username, you can count on it as you can count on the temerity of winter storms.</p>
  <p>
     But, logging in will only give you more access if the owner sees you and grants you access,
     and you will lose access once you log out (unless the owner has set up an out-of-band authorization method like <a href="{{url_for("login",provider="token")}}">token login</a>.)</p>
  <!-- on Ian Goldberg's Nymity Slider, this is "Linkable Anonymity"; "Unlinkable anonymity" is what you have when you're simply not logged in -->
  <p>Your username is already generated. You may choose a display name to go with it if you want to be less anonymous.</p>
  <form method="POST" action="{{action}}">
   <!-- XXX this should really have CSRF protection -->
